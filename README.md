# World-Forge Plugin for [Endless-Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/)
World-Forge is a plugin for content creators and developers of endless-sky, adding a few systems, which have all outfits and ships available to buy.
It is not yet finished, but working.
It does support older pilots without doing harm to them, but also has a altered start for new pilots.

I do not recommend this for playing in super sandbox mode, because the game might actually get boring using all the superweapons, but if you're into that, go ahead.


Thx Derpy Horse and LocalGod for helping.
